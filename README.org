#+TITLE: SilverwareNET Compiler

* About
SilverwareNET is a pseudo-lisp with a ML core targetting the .NET
intermediate language (IL).

Differently from Silverware (Erlang) and Silverware+ (Haskell),
SilverwareNET focuses on leveraging the amazing world of the .NET,
introducing a few features to Silverware:

- Object System (TODO)
- Native Compilation (TODO)
- Interop with other .NET languages (TODO)

** Background
Silverware is a (toy) pseudo-lisp programming language implemented in
the spirit of a ML typed core.

- Silverware had its first conceptual interpreter written in Erlang
  [[https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/spoon][here]]
- Silverware+ is being developed in Haskell with the [[https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/spatula][Spatula
  interpreter]].


* Requirements to run

- Mono for assembling the IL and running the target
- .NET 6 to build the project

* How to test

Currently there is a hardcoded expression to be evaluated, so you can simply run the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
dotnet run --project SilverwareNET
cd SilverwareNET/bin/Debug/net6.0/
ilasm /exe test.il
mono test.exe
#+END_SRC
